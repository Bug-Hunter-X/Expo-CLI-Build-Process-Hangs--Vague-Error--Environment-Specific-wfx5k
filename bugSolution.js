The solution involved a combination of steps to clean up the environment and ensure everything was up-to-date. First, I cleared the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`. Then, I made sure my Node.js version and npm were also up-to-date and consistent across the project. I also checked my system's environment variables to ensure there weren't any conflicts with the build process. Finally, a thorough check of the project's dependencies was performed, and any outdated or conflicting packages were updated or removed.
