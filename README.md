# Expo CLI Build Process Hangs: Vague Error, Environment Specific

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI build process hangs indefinitely without providing a clear error message. The issue is specific to certain local development environments and doesn't occur on other machines.

## Bug Description

When attempting to build an Expo project using the Expo CLI, the process hangs at a seemingly random point. There's no specific error message displayed in the terminal. The project builds successfully on different machines, suggesting a problem with the local setup or a peculiar interaction with the Expo CLI.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android` (depending on your target platform).

The build process will hang without any meaningful error information.

## Potential Causes

* Local environment inconsistencies (Node.js version, system configurations, etc.).
* Caching issues within the Expo CLI or related dependencies.
* Unexpected behavior of the Expo CLI under specific conditions.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the problem in a number of ways, primarily by focusing on ensuring a clean environment and updating potentially conflicting dependencies. This solution is not exhaustive, and other fixes may be required depending on the specific cause of the hang.
